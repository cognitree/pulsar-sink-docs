= Document API
:slug: document-api

In this QuickStart, youâ€™ll use the Stargate Document API plugin to enable schemaless storage of free form JSON Documents in your Astra database. No modeling needed!

To use the Document API, you must define the namespace and collections that will store the data.
A namespace is a container for which a replication factor defines the number of data replicas the database will store.
Collections consist of unstructured JSON documents.
Documents can themselves hold multiple documents.
Multiple collections are contained in a namespace, but a collection cannot be contained in multiple namespaces.

We'll show you you how to:
