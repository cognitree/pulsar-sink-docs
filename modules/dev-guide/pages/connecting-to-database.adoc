= Connect to your database
:slug: connecting-to-database

Connect to Astra the way you want. Use the Stargate Data APIs (schemaless JSON Documents, REST, or GraphQL) or JavaScript SDK from your application, language-specific drivers for server-side code, or the CQL console for direct interaction.


[NOTE]
====
You must create an Astra database or be granted access to a database by another user before establishing connections.
