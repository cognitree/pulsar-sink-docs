Database owners can issue requests to create or modify users in the DataStax Cloud console for other team members.

If you have Organization Administrator rights, you can manage users within your organization.

Database Owners can create additional users with Database Access credentials to access your Astra <+++<glossary:database>+++> using the [Cassandra Query Language (CQL)](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-cql/doc/cql/).+++</glossary:database>+++

Database owners can also modify their passwords for logging in to the DataStax Cloud console and change the password used to access their database.
[NOTE]
====
Users created by another user with administrator privileges do not have CQL `GRANT` privileges and therefore cannot create, delete, or disable users.
