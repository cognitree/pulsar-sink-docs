= DevOps API for managing your databases
:slug: manage-database-with-service-account

Manage your databases with the DevOps API, which can be used to create, terminate, resize, park, and unpark your database.

Use the link:ref:authenticateserviceaccounttoken-1[DevOps API] to perform lifecycle actions for DataStax Astra databases.
. To use the DevOps API, xref:creating-a-new-service-account-for-your-database.adoc[create a service account] for your organization.
. Create a token to xref:authenticateserviceaccounttoken-1.adoc[authenticate your service account] in the DevOps API.
. Once you have authenticated your service account, you can [create](ref:createdatabase-1), [terminate](ref:terminatedatabase-1), [resize](ref:resizedatabase-1), [park](ref:parkdatabase-1), and [unpark](ref:unparkdatabase-1) databases using the DevOps API.

When you use the DevOps API reference, paste the authentication token in the Bearer Auth field after you select *Try It* for your selected command.
This authenticates your service account so you can run the command.
