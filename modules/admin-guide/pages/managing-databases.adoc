= Manage your databases
:slug: managing-databases

Resize, park, and terminate databases based on usage needs.

Resizing a database allows you to add instances or storage capacity to expand the database, or scale down to a minimum of three instances if you have unused resources or remove large amounts of data.

You can park a database when not in use, and resume use at any time.
The DataStax Cloud console indicates the cost of parking a database versus its cost when running.

Terminate databases not in use to reduce costs and eliminate unused resources.
[NOTE]
====
You must be the owner or have ownership rights to modify database properties.
To obtain connection details for a database you did not create, contact the database owner and ask them for the xref:obtaining-database-credentials.adoc[connection details].
