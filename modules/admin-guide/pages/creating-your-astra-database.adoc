. Select your tier and plan based on your application needs.
See xref:service-tier-options.adoc[Service tier options] for a description of your plan options.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot change your tier after creating your <+++<glossary:database>+++>.
====

For paid tiers, you can increase your capacity unit (CUs) to increase the storage size of the database for the selected plan.

[NOTE]
====
You can have only one Free database at a time.
====

. Select your cloud provider:
 * AWS
 * GCP
 * Azure

[NOTE]
====
There is no choice for the cloud provider for the Free tier.
====

. Select the <+++<glossary:region>+++> where you want to launch your database from the region menu, which reflects the available regions based on your selected cloud provider.

[NOTE]
====
You can preview estimated costs for the database **Per Minute** or **Per Month.** The estimates are calculated for when the database is running and parked.
====

. Select **Configure Database** to continue.
. Enter your database details:
 * **Database Name:** Name your database something meaningful.
The database name cannot be altered after the database is created.
Use only alphanumeric characters; there is no character limit.
 * **Keyspace Name:** Name your <+++<glossary:keyspace>+++> to reflect your data model.
You can't name your keyspace `dse` or `system`.
Use only alphanumeric characters and no more than 48 total characters.
 * **Database Username:** Your username should be useful.
You can't name your user `cassandra`, `root`, `dse`, or `system`.
Use only alphanumeric characters and no more than 48 total characters.
Astra forces usernames to lowercase;
enclose the name in quotes to preserve case or use special characters in the name.
 * **Database Password:** Make sure your password is secure.
Use at least 8 alphanumeric characters.
We recommend you use capital and lowercase letters along with numbers to keep your data safe.
You must enter your database password again to confirm the password.

. Select **Create Database**.
. If you are creating your first database on a paid tier and you do not have a payment method available, enter and **Save** the required **New Card** information.
. Select **Launch Database** to create the database.

==Results
You are redirected to your **Organization Dashboard**. The new database and status is shown under **Databases**.

You will receive an email when your database creation is complete. Select the database name to manage or connect with your new database.
