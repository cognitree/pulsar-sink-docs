----

name:: Unique name for the connector.

 Default: `cassandra-sink`

connector.class:: DataStax connector Java class provided in the `pulsar-connect-cassandra-sink-N.N.N.jar`

 Default: `com.datastax.pulsarconnector.CassandraSinkConnector`

tasks.max::
Maximum number of tasks created for the connector instance.
The connector can create fewer tasks if it cannot achieve this level of parallelism.

....
**Note:** Use additional Pulsar Connect workers to scale the connector when more throughput is needed. For connector instances to split tasks, they must have the same `group.id`, which is configured in the connect-distributed.properties file. Parallelism is limited by the partitions of the Pulsar topic.

Default: `1`
....

cloud.secureConnectBundle::
The full path to the secure connect bundle for your DataStax Astra database (secure-connect-database_name.zip).
Download the xref:../../dscloud/astra/dscloudObtainingCredentials.adoc[secure connect bundle] from the DataStax Cloud console.

 If this option is specified, you must also include the auth.username and auth.password for the database user.
