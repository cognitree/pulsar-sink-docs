= Astra plan options
:slug: service-tier-options

Plans affect the features, storage, and pricing of your database.

For all paid plans, you can park, unpark, terminate, and and resize the databases with the xref:managing-databases.adoc[user interface] or the xref:manage-database-with-service-account.adoc[DevOps API].
[NOTE]
====
To compare these tiers to Apache Cassandraâ„¢ sizing, treat the initial paid databas with a replication factor of three as three Cassandra instances in three separate racks.
====

== Serverless (Beta)

[DANGER]
====
Serverless databases are a Beta feature.
Use this database option at your own risk.
====

The Serverless database is an elastic cloud-native database that scales with your workload.
You can scale your compute and storage capabilities independently.
This allows you to focus on developing your application and less on your infrastructure costs.

Only one GCP region is available for Serverless databases.
Serverless databases don't support VPC peering or multi-region databases.
You cannot resize or park your Serverless database.

== Dev and Test with Shared Resources
Dev and Test databases offer an entry point for developers.
Only select AWS and GCP regions are available for the Dev and Test databases.
Dev and Test databases don't support VPC peering or multi-region databases.
