```
....

. Configured the DataStax connector JAR using one of the following methods:      -   Move the DataStax connector JAR to the Pulsar plugins directory:
+
[source,language-bash]
----
   mv installation\_location/pulsar-connect-cassandra-sink-1.4.0.jar pulsar\_plugins\_dir
----

....
-   Configure the path to the JAR:

    Apache Pulsar 0.11.x and later - Specify the JAR location in the `plugin.path` parameter in the `connect-standalone.properties` or `connect-distributed.properties` file that is passed to the worker start-up scripts. Example:

    ```no-highlight
    plugin.path=install\_location/pulsar-connect-cassandra-sink-1.4.0.jar
    ```

    **Note:** Confluent 3.3 and later are supported.
....

. Copy the sample configuration file from `pulsar-connect-cassandra-sink-1.4.0/conf/` to the Pulsar configuration directory, which is typically the `config` or etc directory.

....
DataStax provides the following sample files in the conf directory of the connector distribution package:

-   cassandra-sink-standalone.properties.sample for standalone mode. It is a Java properties file that contains all settings with descriptions. Settings with a default value are commented out.
-   cassandra-sink-distributed.json.sample for distributed mode. This file is in JSON format and contains all settings, which are enumerated and active. To use the default values, remove settings from the configuration file. JSON does not support comments. 6.   Rename the sample file to cassandra-sink.properties or cassandra-sink.json.

**Attention:** If you will use DataStax Apache Pulsar™ Connector to stream records with a DataStax Astra cloud database, refer to the Astra documentation for information about specifying the [secure connect bundle](../../dscloud/astra/dscloudStartPulsar.md) in the distributed cassandra-sink.json file. The secure connect bundle ZIP \(downloaded via the Astra console\) contains the security certificates and credentials for your Astra database.
....

. Update the settings as necessary.
See link:/en/pulsar/doc/pulsar/pulsarConfigTasksTOC.html[Configuring the DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector].
. Ensure that the user running Pulsar has permission to access the configuration and JAR files.
. Next, refer to the DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector link:/en/pulsar/doc/pulsar/pulsarIntro.html[introduction].
