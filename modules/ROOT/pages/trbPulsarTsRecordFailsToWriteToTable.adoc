= Record fails to write
:imagesdir: _images

Records never appear in the DataStax Enterprise (DSE) database table.
The cause can be issues with node availability, transient errors that prevent writes due to consistency level, a schema change where a mapped column was removed from the target table, and so forth.

== Remediation

Verify the following:

* Check for WARN and ERROR messages in the Pulsar Connect log.
* Check for WARN and ERROR on the system.log on the DSE coordinator node.
* Status of writes.
