Vary depending on the workload and network capacity.

The system requirements for DataStax Apache Kafkaâ„¢ Connector depends on the workload and network capacity.
The factors include characteristics of the Kafka topic and the cluster data models and volume.
DataStax recommends testing with realistic data flows before committing to an instance type for the connector.

DataStax Apache Kafka Connector is bound by the amount of CPU available on the host.
The connector holds all the records pulled from Kafka topics in memory, along with the cluster metadata and prepared statements.
Memory pressure is influenced by:

* Record size of Kafka topics
* Number of records pulled at the same time;
where the maximum is set by the workers `consumer.max.poll.records` parameter.
* Number of simultaneous tasks run by the connector;
See xref:../kafkaConfigTasksMax.adoc[Configuring parallelism].

DataStax Apache Kafka Connector needs adequate network capacity for the payload.
This includes the connections from Kafka Servers to the target platform.
Scale the connector horizontally by adding additional workers in distributed mode to increase overall throughput.

TIP: The DataStax Apache Kafka Connector framework automatically rebalances the load when workers are added by reallocating the tasks among the workers.
