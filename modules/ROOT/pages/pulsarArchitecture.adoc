The DataStax Apache Pulsar™ Connector is deployed on the Pulsar Connect Worker nodes and runs within the worker JVM.
The Pulsar Connect Worker Framework handles automatic rebalancing of tasks when new nodes are added and also ships with a built-in REST API for operator actions.
Running the connector in this framework enables multiple DataStax connector instances to share the load and to scale horizontally when run in Distributed Mode.
The diagram below shows how the DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector fits into the Pulsar ecosystem.

The environment is comprised of the following components:

* *Data sources* - Original source of the data, such as databases, applications, and other services like Salesforce and Twitter.
* *Pulsar platform*
 ** *Pulsar brokers* - Responsible for storing Pulsar topics.
 ** *Pulsar connect workers* - The nodes running the Pulsar connect framework that run producer and consumer plug-ins (Pulsar connectors).
  *** *Source connectors* - Push messages (data) from the original sources to Pulsar brokers.
  *** *Sink connectors* - Workers running one or more instances of the DataStax Pulsar Connector, which pulls messages from Pulsar topics and writes them to a database table on the DataStax platform using the DataStax Enteprise Java driver.
* *DataStax platform* - DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector synchronizes records from a Pulsar topic with table rows in the following supported databases:
 ** https://docs.astra.datastax.com/docs[DataStax Astra] cloud databases
 ** DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 4.7 and later databases
 ** Open source Apache Cassandra® 2.1 and later databases
