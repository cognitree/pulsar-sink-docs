== Parameters

----
tasks.max=1
cloud.secureConnectBundle=/path/to/secure-connect-database_name.zip
----

tasks.max::
Maximum number of tasks created for the connector instance.
The connector can create fewer tasks if it cannot achieve this level of parallelism.
+
NOTE: Use additional Pulsar Connect workers to scale the connector when more throughput is needed. For connector instances to split tasks, they must have the same `group.id`, which is configured in the connect-distributed.properties file. Parallelism is limited by the partitions of the Pulsar topic.
+
Default: `1`

cloud.secureConnectBundle::
The full path to the secure connect bundle for your DataStax Astra database (secure-connect-database_name.zip).
Download the secure connect bundle from the DataStax Cloud console.
+
If this option is specified, you must also include the auth.username and auth.password for the database user.
