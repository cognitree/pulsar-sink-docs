= Scaling down by removing workers
:imagesdir: _images

Decrease throughput by running the DataStax Connector on fewer workers.

To remove workers from a Pulsar Connect Worker group, simply stop the worker.
The Pulsar Connect framework automatically scales down and rebalances the tasks amongst the alive workers.

TIP: The DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector framework automatically rebalances the load when workers are added by reallocating the tasks among the workers.

. Find the PID of the worker process.

....
```language-bash
ps auwx | grep ConnectDistributed
```

Example out:

```results
automat+ 20689  9.6 10.3 4635620 846012 pts/2  Sl   00:36   0:16 /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_151/bin/java
...
org.apache.pulsar.connect.cli.ConnectDistributed pulsar/config/connect-distributed.properties
```
....

. Kill the process.

 ```language-bash
 kill 20689
 ```
