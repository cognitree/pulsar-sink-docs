[#kafkaConfigTasksMax]
= Configuring parallelism
:imagesdir: _images

Adjusting the number of tasks, simultaneous writes, and batch size.

In order for workers to split DataStax Apache Kafka™ connector tasks, the workers must have the same `group.id` in the `connect-distributed.properties` file.
The parallelism is limited by the partitions for the given Kafka topic.

Example - Kafka topic named `my-topic` has 10 partitions and the connector group is configured to have link:configuration_reference/kafkaConnector.md#tasks_max[20 tasks].
The maximum unit of parallelism in this environment would be 10 because each partitions cannot be subdivided among the tasks.

NOTE: Use additional Apache Kafka™ Connect workers to scale the connector if greater throughput is needed.
