= Configuring parallelism
:imagesdir: _images

In order for workers to split DataStax Apache Pulsar™ connector tasks, the workers must have the same `group.id` in the `connect-distributed.properties` file.
The parallelism is limited by the partitions for the given Pulsar topic.

Example - Pulsar topic named `my-topic` has 10 partitions and the connector group is configured to have link:config-reference:cfgRefPulsarConnector.adoc[20 tasks].
The maximum unit of parallelism in this environment would be 10 because each partitions cannot be subdivided among the tasks.

NOTE: Use additional Apache Pulsar™ Connect workers to scale the connector if greater throughput is needed.
