= How data is written to the target platform
:imagesdir: _images

The Pulsar Connect workers run one or more instances of the DataStax Apache Pulsar™ Connector.
Each instance of the DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector creates a single session with the cluster.
Data is pulled from the Pulsar topic and written to the mapped table using a CQL batch that contains multiple write statements.

DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector can stream records to the following:

* https://docs.astra.datastax.com/docs[DataStax Astra] cloud databases
* DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 4.7 and later databases
* Open source Apache Cassandra® 2.1 and later databases

The database session is created using the DataStax Java driver.
A single connector instance can process records from multiple Pulsar topics and write to several database tables.

A map specification binds a Pulsar topic field to a table column.
Fields that are omitted from the specification are not included in the write request.
Fields with null values are written to the database as `UNSET` (see xref:cfgRefPulsarDseTable.md[nullToUnset]).
To ensure proper ordering, all records are written using the Pulsar record timestamp.

Use multiple connectors when different global connect settings are required for different scenarios, such as writing to different clusters or datacenters.
