[#kafkaColumnWritetimeTimestamp]
= Specify writetime timestamp column
:imagesdir: _images

Optionally specify the column to use for the writetime timestamp when inserting records from Kafka into supported database tables.

In the Kafka topic mapping, you can optionally specify which column should be used to note the timestamp when the Kafka-produced record was inserted into any of the following:

* https://docs.astra.datastax.com/docs[DataStax Astra] cloud databases
* DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 4.7 and later databases
* Open source Apache CassandraÂ® 2.1 and later databases

The mapping setting provides a special property, `__timestamp`.
The format is:

----
topic.my_topic.my_ks.my_table.mapping=col1=key.f1, col2=value.f1, __timestamp=value.f2
----

By default, the database internally tracks the `writetime` timestamp of records inserted from Kafka.
However, this `__timestamp` feature in the mapping supports the scenario where the Kafka records have an explicit timestamp field that you want to use as a writetime for the database record produced by the connector.

IMPORTANT: The column value that you use must be a *number*.

When you map the `__timestamp` value, you may also want to specify the `timeUnit` of the provided timestamp.
The default is `MICROSECONDS`.
For example, if your column used as the timestamp is in a different format (for example `SECONDS`) set it to `SECONDS`.
The connector will automatically transform it to the database's proper numeric timestamp format;
that is, to `MICROSECONDS`.
Example:

----
topic.my_topic.my_ks.my_table.timestampTimeUnit=SECONDS
----
