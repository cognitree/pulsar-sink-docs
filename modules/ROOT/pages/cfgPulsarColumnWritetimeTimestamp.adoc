= Specify writetime timestamp column

In the Pulsar topic mapping, you can optionally specify which column should be used to note the timestamp when the Pulsar-produced record was inserted into any of the following:

* https://docs.astra.datastax.com/docs[DataStax Astra] cloud databases
* DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 4.7 and later databases
* Open source Apache CassandraÂ® 2.1 and later databases

The mapping setting provides a special property, `__timestamp`.
The format is:

[source,language-yaml]
----
topic:
  my_topic:
    my_ks:
      my_table:
        mapping: 'col1=key.f1, col2=value.f1, __timestamp=value.f2'
----

By default, the database internally tracks the `writetime` timestamp of records inserted from Pulsar.
However, this `__timestamp` feature in the mapping supports the scenario where the Pulsar records have an explicit timestamp field that you want to use as a writetime for the database record produced by the connector.

IMPORTANT: The column value that you use must be a *number*.

When you map the `__timestamp` value, you may also want to specify the `timeUnit` of the provided timestamp.
The default is `MICROSECONDS`.
For example, if your column used as the timestamp is in a different format (for example `SECONDS`) set it to `SECONDS`.
The connector will automatically transform it to the database's proper numeric timestamp format;
that is, to `MICROSECONDS`.
Example:

[source,language-yaml]
----
topic:
  my_topic:
    my_ks:
      my_table:
        timestampTimeUnit: SECONDS
----
