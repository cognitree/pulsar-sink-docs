[#pulsarMetricsFailed]
= Failed Pulsar topic record metrics
:imagesdir: _images

Running total or moving averages of Pulsar topic records that could not be processed by a DataStax Apache Pulsar Connector instance.

You can use DataStax Apache Pulsarâ„¢ Connector metrics to return a running total, or moving averages per a specified rate, of Pulsar topic records that the connector instance failed to process because the mapping could not be interpreted.

DataStax Apach Pulsar Connector provides two Mbeans for failed record counts:

* {blank}
+
[source,no-highlight]
----
objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=topic.keyspace.table.failedRecordCount'
----

* {blank}
+
[source,no-highlight]
----
objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=failedRecordsWithUnknownTopic'
----

The `failedRecordCount` Mbean is incremented when Pulsar Connector is able to detect that there was a failure for a specific topic, keyspace, table;
which is the majority case.
The `failedRecordsWithUnknownTopic` Mbean is incremented when Pulsar Connector was not able to detect the Pulsar topic that was associated with a failed record;
this is an edge case.

Count:: Running total of the number of failed records encountered by the connector instance:

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=topic.keyspace.table.failedRecordCount'
  attribute='Count'
 ```

:   Running total of the number of failed records encountered by the connector where the Pulsar topic was unknown:

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=failedRecordsWithUnknownTopic'
  attribute='Count'
 ```

OneMinuteRate:: Moving average of records that failed in the last minute:

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=topic.keyspace.table.failedRecordCount'
  attribute='OneMinuteRate'
 ```

:   Moving average of records that failed in the last minute where the Pulsar topic was unknown:

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=failedRecordsWithUnknownTopic'
  attribute='OneMinuteRate'
 ```

FiveMinuteRate:: Moving average of records that failed in the last five minutes.

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=topic.keyspace.table.failedRecordCount'
  attribute='FiveMinuteRate'
 ```

:   Moving average of records that failed in the last five minutes where the Pulsar topic was unknown:

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=failedRecordsWithUnknownTopic'
  attribute='FiveMinuteRate'
 ```

FifteenMinuteRate:: Moving average of records that failed in the last 15 minutes:

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=topic.keyspace.table.failedRecordCount'
  attribute='FifteenMinuteRate'
 ```

:   Moving average of records that failed in the last 15 minutes where the Pulsar topic was unknown:

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=failedRecordsWithUnknownTopic'
  attribute='FifteenMinuteRate'
 ```

MeanRate:: The mean average number of records that failed since this Pulsar Connector instance was created:

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=topic.keyspace.table.failedRecordCount'
  attribute='MeanRate'
 ```

:   Mean average of records that failed since this Pulsar Connector instance was created, where the Pulsar topic was unknown:

 ```no-highlight
 objectName='com.datastax.pulsarconnector:connector=*,name=failedRecordsWithUnknownTopic'
  attribute='FifteenMinuteRate'
 ```

TIP: See `WARN` level message that includes specific information for each record in the Pulsar Connect worker log.
