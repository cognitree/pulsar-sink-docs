[#pulsarRecordHeaderToTable]
= Extract Pulsar record header values
:imagesdir: _images

In the Pulsar topic mapping, you can extract values from the record's header by using `header.header-field-name`, and write the values to a supported database table:

* https://docs.astra.datastax.com/docs[DataStax Astra] cloud databases
* DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 4.7 and later databases
* Open source Apache CassandraÂ® 2.1 and later databases

For example:

[source,no-highlight]
----
topic.my_topic.my_keyspace.my_table.mapping=col1=key.f1, col2=value.f1, __ttl=value.f2, __timestamp=value.f3,
        col3=header.f4
----

You cannot map the entire header.
Use one or more individual mapping statements to extract the desired values and have them written to the database table.
The Pulsar record's header can have fields that are similar to `key.field-name` or `value.field-name`.

For example, you may want to send the Pulsar record with its key, value, and custom header information such as `trace_id` or another type of internal identifier, and save those values in your database table.
