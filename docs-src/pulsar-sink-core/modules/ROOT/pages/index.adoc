:page-tag: pulsar-connector,planner,dev,admin,pulsar

DataStax Apache Pulsar(TM) Connector is open-source software (OSS) installed in the Pulsar IO framework, and synchronizes records from a Pulsar topic with table rows in DataStax Enterprise (DSE) and Cassandra databases.

== Key Features

* Flexibility in mapping Apache Pulsar(TM) messages to DSE and Cassandra tables.
* Enterprise grade security support including built-in SSL, and LDAP integration.
* Consumes all Apache Pulsar(TM) primitives including primitives, JSON and Avro formats.
* Flexible time/date formatting.
* Configurable consistency level.
* Row-level Time-to-Live (TTL).
* Distributed mode, high availability (HA) support.
* Standalone mode support for development.

== Supported databases

* https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/[DataStax Astra] cloud databases
* DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 4.7 and later databases
* Open source Apache Cassandra(R) 2.1 and later databases

== Supported Pulsar data structures

Ingest data from Pulsar topics with records in the following data structures:

* Primitive string values
* Complex field values in record types:
 ** Avro
 ** JSON formatted string with JSON schema
 ** JSON formatted string inside a schemaless topic

== Advanced message mapping topics

If you're already familiar with Apache Pulsar(TM) and DSE/Astra/Cassandra(R) see the following advanced message mapping topics:

* xref:cfgPulsarDisplayingTopic.adoc[] Display messages to determine the data structure of the topic messages.
* xref:cfgPulsarMapKeyPair.adoc[] Create a topic-table map for Pulsar messages that only contain a key and value in each record.
* xref:cfgPulsarMapJson.adoc[] For JSON fields, map individual fields in the structure to columns.
* xref:cfgPulsarMapAvroMessages.adoc[] Supports mapping individual fields from a Avro format field.
* xref:cfgPulsarRecordHeaderToTable.adoc[] Extract values from Pulsar record header and write to the database table.
* xref:cfgPulsarMapUdt.adoc[] Write complex types directly into User-defined Types (UDT).
* xref:cfgPulsarMapMultipleTables.adoc[] Ingest a single topic into multiple tables using a single connector instance.
* xref:cfgPulsarMultTopicToTables.adoc[] Ingest multiple topics and write to different tables using a single connector instance.
* xref:cfgPulsarSelectiveUpdateMapsAndUdts.adoc[] Selectively update maps and UDTs based on Pulsar fields.
* xref:cfgPulsarCqlQuery.adoc[] Provide CQL queries when new record arrives on the Pulsar topic.
* xref:cfgPulsarNowFunction.adoc[] You can use the now() function in mappings.
